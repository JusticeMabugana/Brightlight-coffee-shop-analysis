### ☕**Coffee_Shop Analysis** 

This repository contains an analysis of a coffee shop franchise, based in 3 locations, over the period between Jan 2023 and June 2023.
The goal for this analysis is to identify sales trends across the 3 locations, sales trends over the time period, and sales trends across the different product offerings.
These findings will assist management and the C.E.O in making informed, data-driven decisions. 




## **Findings and Recommendations**

📍🏠**Revenue per location**
   - Hell’s Kitchen generates the highest revenue, contributing 33.8%, while Lower Manhattan brings in the least, with 32.9%.


📆**Busy days findings**

   - Our busiest days are Mondays and Fridays, generating 30% of the week’s revenue
   - Our least busy days are weekends (Sat and Sun), generating just under 28% of the week’s revenue
 
   - **Astoria** tends to be busiest from Wednesday to Friday, while the least active days are typically Tuesday and Saturday.
   - This pattern may be influenced by **Astoria's** location; if it is situated in a business district that sees less foot traffic on weekends, this could contribute to lower sales figures.
     

   - **Lower Manhattan** experiences a surge in activity on Mondays, whereas Sundays tend to have the least engagement.
   - This lack of activity on Sundays could be a significant reason for **Lower Manhattan's** lower revenue compared to other coffee shops.

     
   - **Hell’s Kitchen** stands out as the most profitable of the three shops, consistently selling over 10,000 units daily, with the exception of Sundays.

   - This impressive performance may be linked to its prime location. Additionally, it could be influenced by aspects that other shops might adopt, such as  quality of service and  shop cleanliness.

 **Busy days Recommendations**   

   - It might be worthwhile to reassess **Astoria's** trading hours on weekends.
   - Additionally, **Astoria** should consider implementing special promotions on Tuesdays to boost activity
   - It might be worthwhile for **Lower Manhattan** to reevaluate its Sunday trading hours or offerings, tailoring them to better meet the needs of the visitors in the area on that day.
   - Perhaps we may re-asses the trading hours on weekends and/or introduce specials


 📈**Growth findings**
   - All three coffee shops experienced a decline in sales from January to February.  
   - However, each shop observed a strong increase in units sold over the following five months.  
   - The coffee shops have experienced growth of over **100% in 6 months**, which is remarkable,
   - The typical growth target for coffee shops comparable to ours is approximately 5% per month.
   - Our coffee shop has achieved **month-to-month growth rates reaching as high as 33%**, significantly surpassing market expectations.
