## **Findings and Recommendations**
 
   - **Astoria** tends to be busiest from Wednesday to Friday, while the least active days are typically Tuesday and Saturday.
   - This pattern may be influenced by **Astoria's** location; if it is situated in a business district that sees less foot traffic on weekends, this could contribute to lower sales figures.
   - It might be worthwhile to reassess **Astoria's** trading hours on weekends.
   - Additionally, consider implementing special promotions on Tuesdays to boost activity.

  - **Lower Manhattan** experiences a surge in activity on Mondays, whereas Sundays tend to have the least engagement.
  - This lack of activity on Sundays could be a significant reason for **Lower Manhattan's** lower revenue compared to other coffee shops.
  - It might be worthwhile for **Lower Manhattan** to reevaluate its Sunday trading hours or offerings, tailoring them to better meet the needs of the visitors in the area on that day.
